My name is Jeffrey, and I most recently worked for Quality Gold INC with, Corey Meyer. 
What made me come into Max Technical Training's Coding Bootcamp, was my personal interest in web development, coding and programming. Although I am going into this not knowing much I am determined to work hard and achieve what I've signed up for. Even now I am surprising myself.
I am excited for what journey lies ahead for me in the coding field and I thank Max Technical Training for this opportunity and your desire to help me through this bootcamp.
